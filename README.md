# Legacy Duplicator Mod
Back during the 1.12.2 modding days, I used MCreator to make a mod called the Duplicator Mod. Its purpose was straightforward: It added machines that would allow you to duplicate blocks and items. Unfortunately, sense it was made with MCreator (and way back in 1.12.2) I was pushing MCreator and causing bugs and using not so great code, which wasn't helped by how inexperienced I was. Despite this, I had uploaded it to the MCreator website, and to my shock, it got thousands of downloads and many seemed to like it! Now that I have somewhat decent modding experience and can make mods without MCreator, I have decided to remake my old mod today for 1.21.1. Featuring better code and (kind of) better textures, here's my remake of my legacy duplicator mod!

## Features
### Basic Duplicator
The Basic Duplicator will duplicate any block placed on top of it to underneath it when interacted with a duplicator stick. The Basic Duplicator does have some blacklisted blocks:

<summary>Blacklisted Blocks</summary>
  
- Basic Duplicator
- All Item Duplicators
- Netherite Block
- Diamond Block
- Emerald Block
- Lapis Block
- Gold Block

</details>

### Item Duplicators
The Item Duplicators all have varying amounts of items they can duplicate. By placing your item in the leftmost slot and a duplicator stick in the bottom slot, you can click the duplicate button to duplicate your item. Upgrading your item duplicator will get you a bigger max capacity. Item duplicators also have some blacklisted items:

- Basic Duplicator
- All Item Duplicators
- Duplicator Stick
- Infiniduplicator Stick
- Infiniduplicator Stick Part
- Unduplicatable Items
- Shulker Box
- Bundle

</details>

### Infiniduplicator Stick Part Maker
I know it's not a great name, but it is what I called it back in the 1.12.2 version. This block will take in certain items (revealed when hovering over the i icon), and upon hitting the craft button will create a infiniduplicator stick part.

### Unduplicatable Item One & Two
These are special items that are purely designed for not being duplicatable (don't ask why, apparently several years ago me really wanted them) and they cost a ridiculous amount of diamonds, at 9 diamond blocks, and then 9 of the previous item.

### Infiniduplicator Stick
The most OP item in the mod, this item acts as a replacement for the duplicator stick, but lasts forever. To get this you'll need 3 infiniduplicator stick parts and 6 duplicator sticks.
